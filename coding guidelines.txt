A few important rules/guidelines for coding.
"Knowing how to code" is really as much about making sure your code is as 
readable as possible as it is about anything else.
(Especially for relatively straightforward like in web design.)
They aren't teaching us that very much in the workshops, 
so I am putting it briefly in this file. :)


1. Use conventions, keep it consistent

Use the same notation for everything according to the code it's written in.
For example, in html and css variables are written like this: "my-first-variable".
No caps, separated by dashes. Same with file names. Conventions makes it easier
to know what is what in code and minimises confusion, it's very important.

Note: conventions aren't the same in every language. If we had javascript files,
the convention for variables would be to write them like this: "myFirstVariable" 
(this is called camelCase https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case), 
and only in those javascrit files.


2. HTML has a bunch of elements. Always use them!

MDN is the best documentation for html/css/javascript. Here is a list of all
html elements https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element.
Always use the most specific element you can use.
If you're writing a paragraph, use <p>. If you have a section, use <section>.
If you have a link, use <a>. Ordered lists use <ol>, unordered lists use <ul> 
and they both contain individual list elenets <li>. There are a looooot more, try
to make sure you use the right ones.

This is important for two reasons: it makes the html that much more readable 
(if the code is just <div> everywhere, you have no idea what is what), and screen readers
(software that literally reads the screen out loud for people who can't see) makes
use of elements to properly read out the page, without the proper elements it becomes
unreadable and you make your page less accessible.


3. Generic styling goes in css files

Always put element styling in a separate css file, NOT in the html file (this is called
"inline styling" and it should be avoided.) It makes it easier to organise styling for the
document.
